My capstone team completed a forecasting dashboard for monthly active users (MAU) using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model with 5% mean absolute percent error over a 16 week period. My paper discusses cross-validation results, model hyperparameters, and application/systems engineering.

You can download my paper on this site. My co-authors have written separate papers for this project and you can contact me if you would like to request their paper.
